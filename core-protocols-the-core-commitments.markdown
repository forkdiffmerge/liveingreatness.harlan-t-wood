## The Core Commitments

1. I commit to engage when present. 

* To know and disclose 

1. what I want,
2. what I think, and
3. what I feel.

* To always seek effective help.
* To decline to offer and refuse to accept incoherent emotional transmissions.
* When I have or hear a better idea than the currently prevailing idea, I will immediately either 

1. propose it for decisive acceptance or rejection, and/or
2. explicitly seek its improvement.

* I will personally support the best idea 

1. regardless of its source,
2. however much I hope an even better idea may later arise, and
3. when I have no superior alternative idea.

2. I will seek to perceive more than I seek to be perceived.
3. I will use teams, especially when undertaking difficult tasks.
4. I will speak always and only when I believe it will improve the general results/effort ratio.
5. I will offer and accept only rational, results-oriented behavior and communication.
6. I will disengage from less productive situations 

* When I cannot keep these commitments,
* When it is more important that I engage elsewhere.

7. I will do now what must be done eventually and can effectively be done now.
8. I will seek to move forward toward a particular goal, by biasing my behavior toward action.
9. I will use the Core Protocols (or better) when applicable. 

* I will offer and accept timely and proper use of the [Protocol Check][1] protocol without prejudice.

10. I will neither harm—nor tolerate the harming of—anyone for his or her fidelity to these commitments.
11. I will never do anything dumb on purpose.
