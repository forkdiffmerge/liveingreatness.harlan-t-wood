## Boot Camp – Immersive Training

A reliable way to create a great team is to run a Boot Camp. Boot Camp is a 
5-day immersive simulation where teams can intensively practice the Core Protocols. 
In the simulation, the participants:

1. Form a team
2. Envision a product
3. Agree on how it will be made
4. Design and build it

The intense Boot Camp experience includes all of the failures and triumphs 
that occur with normal team formation; the creation of a team-shared vision; 
and the design, implementation, and delivery of a product. The days in each 
Boot Camp are packed with accelerated team dynamics; what usually takes a year 
or more is created in a few long days and nights of exceptionally deep engagement. 

## Becoming a Great Team

The training will teach you skills, but the main thing that Boot Camp provides 
is the _experience_ of being on a great team. Having that feeling makes it 
easier to navigate back to greatness once you return to work with your team. 

Boot Camps are helpful because they can produce a Booted team more quickly 
than if the team were to just use the Core Protocols during day-to-day work. 
Instructors help coach the team as they design and produce their product.

The new skills you learn help you notice the barriers to greatness that exist 
in your mind. Practicing the Core with others helps you strip those barriers 
away. Together with your team you use your skills and your greatness to ship 
a product. The growth is exhilarating, awkward, and painful all at once. You 
feel what being part of a high-performance team is like. Because – you actually 
**are** part of a high-performance team.
