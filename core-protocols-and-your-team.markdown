## The Core Protocols and Your Team

Just as an individual can self-Boot, a group of people can also adopt the Core 
Protocols together. This is called Self Booting a Team, or just Booting a Team. 
To do this, each member of the team that is interested in the Core tells the 
others that he or she will keep the Core Commitments. This means each team 
member can ask each other for help in learning and following the Core.

## Voluntary

**Adopting the Core must be completely voluntary!** Do not coerce anyone to 
use the Core Protocols, as this won’t work – it will cause resentment or worse, 
and will eventually cost the team more later.

## Learning the Protocols

Protocols that are easy and fun to adopt are [Pass (Unpass)][1], [Check Out][2], 
[Check In][3], [Ask For Help][4], and [Perfection Game][5]. [Decider][6] and 
[Resolution][7] are also effective in small groups (7 or less is the best). 

One approach is to work on one or two at a time, together as a group – for 
a week or two each. Once you feel comfortable with those Protocols, add another 
one for another week or two. Do this until you’ve practiced all the Protocols 
together.

As with many skills, you may notice that there are different levels of mastery. 
Using the Core over time in an intentional way yields deeper insights that 
will help you and your team grow.

## Intensive Workshop

Another good technique is an intensive workshop. If you know someone who has 
been Booted – who knows the Core – ask them to come teach a workshop on one 
or several Protocols. This should heavily favor interactive exercises in small 
groups to practice the protocols. In an afternoon it’s possible to learn [Perfection 
Game][5] and [Decider][6]/[Resolution][7], for instance.

If you don’t know anyone who has been to Boot Camp, just run a workshop yourself 
– ask on the mailing list for help! (See the [Resources][8] page for more information 
on how to subscribe to the mailing list.)
