## Meet

### Purpose

Use when one or more people meet to accomplish something.

### Steps

1. Check In.
State What You Want.

State, in a succinct way, what you want to get from this meeting.

Examples:

1. 

* “I want to know what our message is for this version.”
* “I want ideas for how to improve morale on this team.”
* “I want to Perfection Game how that last customer meeting went.”

If you want what someone else wants in the meeting, you may state that as your 
Meeting Alignment. Example: “I want the same thing that Joe wants.”

1. Alignment Check.

At any point during the meeting, especially when a lull occurs or someone is 
off topic, say “Alignment Check.” At that point each person states, from 1 
to 10, where he or she is in getting what he or she wants. Whoever has the 
lowest score is expected to lead in attaining what he wants. If you give yourself 
a 10 during an Alignment Check, this means you have gotten what you wanted 
and may leave the meeting if desired.

 

Example:

“Alignment Check” “9” “2” “10” “8” “Sue, you said 2, so let’s work on yours.” 

1. Adding Wants (Optional).

If you are at a 10 in getting what you wanted, you may add a new Want.

Example:

“I want to add a new Want. I want to give the team my idea about how to ship 
this product earlier.”

At that point, proceed to get the new Want until you are at a 10.

1. Check Out.

After getting what you want out of the meeting, you may do one of the following: 

1. 

* State a new Want.
* If you have agreed to help someone get what they want, then you would stay until they have gotten their want.
* Check Out

 

### Commitments

* To have a measurable, desired personal outcome for the meeting.
* To get what you say you want from the meeting.
* To hold others accountable for getting what they want.
* To declare and pursue only one Want at a time.
* To re-perform Meeting Alignment when your Want changes during a meeting or if you have a new Want after achieving your previous one.
* To have a relevant Want that is in line with the overall meeting objectives.
* To leave the meeting if you do not know what you want.
* To support others in leaving the meeting when they have what they want (are at a 10).

### Notes

* State any meeting constraints at the beginning of the meeting.
* Split into smaller groups if there are more than 8 participants in a meeting.
* Use Decider to make decisions efficiently.
* Ask for Help to get what you want.
* Example: “Dave, will you help me after this meeting by going over this with me?”
* Take explicit action to pursue what you want from the meeting if you are the lowest on an Alignment Check.
* Do an Intention Check on why you are in the meeting, especially if you don’t know what you want.
* Limit discussions when results do not come quickly. If needed, simply make a presentation and ask for ideas, perfecting, and 1-1 discussions once the meeting is over.
