## Perfection Game

The Perfection Game protocol will support you in your desire to aggregate the 
best ideas. Use it whenever you desire to improve something you’ve created. 

### Steps

1. Perfectee performs an act or presents an object for perfection, optionally saying “Begin” and “End” to notify the Perfector of the start and end of the performance.
2. Perfector rates the value of the performance or object on a scale of 1 to 10 based on how much value the Perfector believes he or she can add.
3. Perfector says “What I liked about the performance or object was X,” and proceeds to list the qualities of the object the Perfector thought were of high quality or should be amplified.
4. Perfector offers the improvements to the performance or object required for it to be rated a 10 by saying “To make it a ten, you would have to do X.”

### Commitments

* Accept perfecting without argument.
* Give only positive comments: what you like and what it would take to “give it a 10.”
* Abstain from mentioning what you don’t like or being negative in other ways.
* Withhold points only if you can think of improvements.
* Use ratings that reflect a scale of improvement rather than a scale of how much you liked the object.
* If you cannot say something you liked about the object or specifically say how to make the object better, you must give it a 10.

### Notes

* A rating of 10 means you are unable to add value, and a rating of 5 means you will specifically describe how to make the object at least twice as good.
* The important information to transmit in the Perfection Game protocol improves the performance or object. For example, “The ideal sound of a finger snap for me is one that is crisp, has sufficient volume, and startles me somewhat. To get a 10, you would have to increase your crispness.”
* As a perfectee, you may only ask questions to clarify or gather more information for improvement. If you disagree with the ideas given to you, simply don’t include them.
