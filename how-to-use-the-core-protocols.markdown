## How To Use The Core Protocols

The Core Protocols work because they enable people to experience greatness. 
Being great means dropping behaviors that aren’t great. Those changes are not 
easy, but they can be rewarding.

As with any experiential learning, just reading about the Core isn’t enough 
to effect change. One has to actually **do** the practices to start making 
changes. So where to start?

## Self-Booting

The process of learning the Core Protocols is known as "[Booting][1]" – a reference 
to the process computers go through when they are starting up and loading the 
software they need to operate. Using the Core by yourself is called "Self-Booting". 

If you’re new to the Core, the best place to start is with the [Core Commitments][2]. 
On your own, decide to hold these commitments. Experiment with yourself. Telling 
others that you’re doing this is optional. Remember that it will take some 
time before you can reliably remember the commitments in the midst of your 
life, before you become aware of them when working or when you are with others. 

If keeping all of them at once seems daunting, just pick a few that speak to 
you: seeking effective help, or disengaging from unproductive situations, for 
example.

## Awkwardness

At first, it will feel awkward, as learning any new thing does. That’s natural. 
Press on!

Many of the Core Commitments relate to the Protocols – one view is that the 
Protocols are best practices for helping people keep the Commitments. For instance, 
[Check Out][3] is a way one can disengage from unproductive situations without 
causing confusion, and [Check In][4] is a way to re-engage gracefully. Use 
them when you want to go deeper or be more effective.

If you’re Self-Booting by yourself, you don’t even need to tell others that 
you’re following the Protocols, they are designed so that you can do them without 
calling attention to yourself.
