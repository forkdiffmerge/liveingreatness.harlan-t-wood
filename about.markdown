## About This Site

[![Shadow Sun][1]][2]

 

My intention in building this web site is to help people create a kinder, gentler 
world. The world is faced with a lot of problems – poverty, climate change, 
war, oppression, and hunger to name a few.

We can’t solve these problems alone. Even the great women and men who have 
made significant progress solving these problems were not alone. They were 
organizers. They had teams.

**_Great_** teams.

In whatever you do – whether it’s how you are with yourself, your family, friends, 
work, school, or your community – being great _matters_. Having a world filled 
with great happiness starts with filling your own life with happiness, then 
the lives of those around you. Take this work into your life – the more people 
there are who believe they can make difference, the sooner we will be living 
in the world we dream of.

warmly, adam
